TIMAGING PEPARTMENT 5 MRI / CT
DATE 6 MAY 2017
CT SCAN NO. 107289/290/291/292
NAME MR YOGENDRA KANODIA
CT SCAN OF CHEST, ABDOMEN AND PELVIS
A plain and post contrast High Resolution Spiral CT scan of the Chest, Abdomen
and Pelvis has been performed after administration of neutral oral contrast medium
(2%/ mannitol): Views were taken in arterial phase, late arterial phase and the
venous phase. Appropriate reconstructions have been performed.
Small areas of ground glass densities are seen in the right middle lobe and right
lower lobe. These are probably inflammatory in etiology.
No mediastinal mass or significant lymph adenopathy is detected:
No other focal or diffuse pulmonary pathology is detected:
No pleural pathology is identified.
Multiple bilateral simple cortical cysts are seen in both kidneys, largest measuring
10.5 x 9.1 cm in the left lower pole.
There is sigmoid wall thickening with multiple diverticuli. No evidence of any
peridiverticular fat stranding or fluid collection is seen.
The liver is normal in size, shape and position. No focal area of altered attenuation
is detected: The biliary tree is not dilated:
The gall bladder reveals no definite focal abnormality.
The pancreas reveals no focal abnormality.
The spleen and adrenals reveal no significant abnormality.
No paraaortic adenopathy is detected:
No pelvic abnormality is noted.
CONCLUSION:
There is sigmoid diverticulosis without any peridiverticular
inflammatory changes seen.
No significant abnormality identified in chest, abdomen and pelvis:

CT SCAN NO. 107289/290/291/292
NAME MR: YOGENDRA KANODIA
CT: CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY
Prospective triggered axial sections of the heart have been obtained
prior to
administration of I.V. contrast to obtain a calcium score.
AC.T Coronary angiography has been performed after injection of80 ml of
400mg% LV. contrast medium  Images have been obtained with ECG gating and
retrospective reconstructions have been performed during the diastolic phase.
Appropriate curved MIP , SSD and VRT images have been obtained
Stent is noted in the proximal LAD which appears to be patent:
There is a small soft plaque proximal to the proximal LAD stent causing no
significant narrowing of its lumen:
Soft plaque is seen in the proximal RCA causing mild to moderate narrowing of
its lumen approximately 30%.
No anomalous coronary arteries are noted
The ostium of both coronary arteries reveal no abnormality.
The right coronary artery is normal in course and caliber:
There is no evidence of
focal narrowing of the lumen: No significant calcific or soft plaques are noted
The posterior descending artery reveal no abnormality.
The left main artery reveal no abnormality.
The DI-D2 reveal no abnormality.
Both internal mammary arteries are normal in course and caliber:
CONCLUSION 8
This examination reveals a stent in situ the proximal LAD, which
appears to be patent:
Small soft plaque is seen in the proximal RCA and proximal LAD.
These however do not cause any significant narrowing of its lumen.
No other significant abnormality is identified in the coronary arteries:
